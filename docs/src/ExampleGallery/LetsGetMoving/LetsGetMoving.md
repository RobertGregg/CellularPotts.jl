# Let's Get Moving

Many cells have the ability to move within their environment through the contraction of actin filaments. This mechanism leads to cells performing an **"intermittent random walk"** which is characterized by periods of persistent movement, followed by periods of being stationary.

Let's see how we can add this kind of behavior to our model,

Start by loading in the `CellularPotts.jl` package and creating a space where cells can exist.

````julia
using CellularPotts
space = CellSpace(100,100; diagonal=true)
````

````
100ร100 Periodic 8-Neighbor CellSpace{Int64,2}
````

Much like in the [HelloWorld.jl](https://robertgregg.github.io/CellularPotts.jl/dev/ExampleGallery/HelloWorld/HelloWorld/) example, we create a single cell that averages 500 pixels in size.

````julia
initialCellState = CellState(:Epithelial, 500, 1; positions = size(space) .รท 2);
````

Now the important part. To enable this type of cellular movement, we can add a `MigrationPenalty` to the model. This penalty requires 3 inputs:

1. A maximum activity
2. A scaling factor for this penalty (one for each cell type)
3. The size of the space

````julia
penalties = [
    AdhesionPenalty([0 30;
                    30 30]),
    VolumePenalty([5]),
    PerimeterPenalty([0,10]),
    MigrationPenalty(50, [50], size(space))
    ]
````

````
4-element Vector{Penalty}:
 Adhesion
 Volume
 Perimeter
 Migration
````

Create a Cellular Potts Model object

````julia
cpm = CellPotts(space, initialCellState, penalties);
````

We can adjust the "temperature" of the model (which defaults to 20). Higher temperatures will make model updates that increase the overall energy more likely. This is not necessary for this model, but a helpful feature to know.

````julia
cpm.temperature = 25.0
````

````
25.0
````

Our model is more ready for simulation! This can be done using the using the `ModelStep!` function, interactively through the `CellGUI` function, or recorded as a gif using `recordCPM`. Any options to the GLMakie `record` function can be passed through.

````julia
recordCPM("LetsGetMoving.gif", cpm)
````
