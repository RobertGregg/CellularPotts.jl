# Utility to get articulation points
####################################################

#=
NOTE: Graphs.jl has an articulation() function which is very good. I went through the trouble of creating this utility to avoid allocations because articulation checks are done after each MHStep. Depending on the space size this gives a 1.2x to 5x speedup.

"""
    ArticulationUtility(n::Int)
Create a new `ArticulationUtility` to hold variables used in the articulation point calculation.

This data structure contains the following fields:
 - discoveryTime`::Vector{Int}`: The time step where the node was discovered
 - low`::Vector{Int}`: Minimum discovery time when you account for back edges
 - parent`::Vector{Int}`: Parent node (i.e. how we got to this node)
 - visited`::BitVector`: Track if node has been visited
 - articulationPoints`::Vector{Int}`: List of articulation vertices
 - nodeIDs`::Vector{Int}`: Tracks the node IDs belonging to the current cell
 - time`::Int`: Increments by 1 every time a new node is discovered
 - cellID``::Int`: Cell ID (i.e. subgraph) we are testing for

Here `n`` is the number of vertices in the graph being tested
